# Welcome to Homectl Blog!

Homectl is my small home automation project. I'm hooking up a bunch of sensors
to my house, replacing my thermostat with a wireless relay, and controlling it
via a Raspberry Pi server in the living room. On this blog, I'll share my
progress, inevitable mistakes, and things I've learned from them and other
experiments.

This blog was recently started after I broke some of the components of a small
hardware project I'm working on, and figured I'd open them up and share what I
find inside. A friend of mine has a [blog](https://olives.aztwantie.de/) where
he shares his code and things he's learned. I always thought that's pretty cool,
but I'd never have time for that. Turns out, maybe I do! At least for now, I'm
writing these things for myself, kind of as a journal. If any of this stuff is
useful or interesting to you, or if you see me doing something stupid (very
likely!), feel free to drop me an email.
